# Type Racer -- Standalone Application
Just something as a little side project.

This probably isn't the best idea/project to create as practice with JavaFX and the Scene Builder, but I've always been interested in typeracer.com despite how somewhat simple, yet effective it is at helping people improve their typing skills. I also really like desktop applications as opposed to web applications, so this will be a neat test for me and keep me busy.
