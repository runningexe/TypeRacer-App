# Type Racer -- Standalone Application

The point of this is to get used to JavaFX and the Scene Builder.

The goal I want to achieve with this project is to somewhat emulate typeracer.com without using any APIs in relation to the site. 

This is going to utilize JavaFX as the GUI framework front-end and SQLite as the back-end.

I don't plan on taking this project too seriously. It's mainly just for fun and practice.
